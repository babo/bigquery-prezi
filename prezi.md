# BigQuery

- easy to use
- fully managed
- analytics engine
- for big data
- SQL queries
- fast

???
- Thank you for joining us today!
- no hardware, no virtual machines, no software to install
- it doesn't matter what size of data
- what type of queries you do
---
# Elevator pitch
- analytics
- not just for your data scientist
???
Your guess were correct
- I'm here to represent the Norwegian office of Nordcloud
- attila.babo@nordcloud.com
- little background
# Please raise your hand

- heard of BigQuery
- using analytics
    - SQL for analytics
    - BigQuery for analytics
---
# Goal: try it at home!

- practical introduction
- live demos
- hands-on experience using BigQuery
- enough information and a burning desire to try it with your own data

???
- the power of curiosity
- this presentation is shared with you
- please share it with your colleagues and like minded friends

# Does big data matter to me?

- more data than you can process in the amount of time you are willing to spend waiting for it
- ...amount of money...

# It's easy to get big data

- over time
- viral sharing
- project growth
- architectural limitations

???
- I don't have problems at petabyte scale
- as the amount of data grows the amount of pain doing simple things like backup or schema changes are exponentially worse
- BigQuery
    - My current solution is fine
    - I've checked it a few years back but it was too limited and pricey
    - I'm not feeling safe to use it

I understand your concerns, please bear with us!
My personal goal is to address these.

- million records a day for years
- 10 actions from a million user per day
- business to business
- intense computation over your data like machine learning

# Demo to give you an impression

    SELECT
      title,
      sum(views) as views
    FROM
      [bigquery-samples:wikimedia_pageviews.201207]
    GROUP EACH BY title
    ORDER BY views DESC
    LIMIT 100

- show data size in GB and number of rows
- wikipedia 1-5
- show a mission impossible: effective regular expression in queries

## How to get my data in?

- anywhere -> Google Cloud Storage -> BigQuery Storage
???
- all these demos were against a public dataset
- Wikipedia is great but what about MY data?
- to demo it with real data
- use a "small" CSV file from a public dataset
    - from my machine, using command line, explain while compress
    - start it, but have an uploaded copy to rescue
- explain the data flow: mac -> storage -> BigQuery table
- explain the content, data types
- create the table, if it arrived use it or the present copy
- .. This'll take a while, let's move on

# SMS, call, internet usage in Milano
![](milano_grid1.png)
.footnote[https://dandelion.eu/datagems/SpazioDati/telecom-sms-call-internet-mi/resource/]

???
- telecommunication activity over the city of Milano
- based on Call Detail Records (CDRs) generated by the Telecom Italia cellular network
- user activity for billing purposes and network management
    - incoming call
    - outgoing call
    - received SMS
    - sent SMS
    - internet traffic
- Internet: a CDR is generate each time
    a user starts an internet connection
    a user ends an internet connection
    during the same connection one of the following limits is reached:â€‹
    15 minutes from the last generated CDR
    5 MB from the last generated CDR
- Square id: the id of the square that is part of the Milano GRID; TYPE: numeric
- Time interval: the beginning of the time interval expressed as the number of millisecond elapsed from the Unix Epoch on January 1st, 1970 at UTC. The end of the time interval can be obtained by adding 600000 milliseconds (10 minutes) to this value. TYPE: numeric
- Country code: the phone country code of a nation. Depending on the measured activity this value assumes different meanings that are explained later. TYPE: numeric
- SMS-in activity: the activity in terms of received SMS inside the Square id, during the Time interval and sent from the nation identified by the Country code. TYPE: numeric
- SMS-out activity: the activity in terms of sent SMS inside the Square id, during the Time interval and received by the nation identified by the Country code. TYPE: numeric
- Call-in activity: the activity in terms of received calls inside the Square id, during the Time interval and issued from the nation identified by the Country code. TYPE: numeric
- Call-out activity: the activity in terms of issued calls inside the Square id, during the Time interval and received by the nation identified by the Country code. TYPE: numeric
- Internet traffic activity: the activity in terms of performed internet traffic inside the Square id, during the Time interval and by the nation of the users performing the connection identified by the Country code . TYPE: numeric

# Analytics as we know it
- SQL is great
- indexes are great
- there are known limitations
    - asking a question you never asked before
    - running a query on the full dataset
- scaling up?
- tune it once again?
???
# IMPORT DATA!
- [console](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/)
- after the demos let's back to our topic: analytics
- limit could be memory size, disk space, available IO capacity or "just" money
- tuning a database for quick queries is an art
    - indexes
    - stripe data across disks
    - separate transaction logs
- full tables scans are daunting
- process it on an external system like Hadoop
---
# Solution
- scale out strategy
    - fan out queries to thousands of servers
    - read from tens or hundreds of thousands of disks
    - return answers in memory
- started at Google by internal need
    - use data for decisions
    - use SQL to formulate questions
    - get answers interactively
    - even for ad-hoc questions
- available for the general public since 2012
???
- 100MB/sec for a disk
- how to read a terabyte in a second
    - skip a lot of data
    - expensive hardware
    - run it in parallel, thousands of disks, hundreds of servers
- part of they BigData stack 2.0
---
# Current state
- open interfaces
    - REST, WebUI
- API with JSON data
    - Tableau, Excel, R, Pandas etc.
- flexible, multiple input sources
- data output
    - easy data management with ACL (Access Control List)
    - joined and shared datasets
- safe data storage
- affordable
???
- started as an internal only product, one of the secret sauce of Google's success
- fully managed
- data is stored safely
- ODBC
- streaming injection, data is available immediately
- single namespace, join table from anywhere
- highly parallelized, compressed, replicated storage
- not just a throw away datastore

- Don't build of your own
- Use it, it's a competitive advantage!
---
# Architecture
![](diagram.png)
???
- disk speed as bottleneck
- for a table scan a traditional DB reads the whole row
- in BigQuery the system loads data only what you are care about
- that speeds up lot of the queries
- queries come in through the root
- sharded and split at intermediate servers, they will do aggregation like grouping and ordering
- leaf nodes are thousands of machines, they do filtering, selection
- they read the columnar storage in parallel
- they do reductions all the way up

---
# Column oriented storage
![](column.png)
???
- compressible, show it!
- read multiple copies in parallel
---
# Demo of a small dataset
.footnote[https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/]
???
# IMPORT DATA!
- use webui
- move on from numbers, demo it with tableau
- switch to the full dataset
- move on from numbers, use an iPython notebook with Julia as backend with gadfly
- Excel, R
---
# Technical highlights
- fast, atomic imports
- live data
    - streaming injection API (100k rows/second per table)
- web console, connectors for R, iPython, Pandas, Excel
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations inside BigQuery
- integrated with some of the industry-leading tools
    - loading
    - transforming
    - visualizing data
    - exporting
    - de-duplication
---
# Feels like SQL, seems like SQL
- a rich SQL language
    - extends with nested and repeated fields
    - JSON queries
    - raw JSON fields
    - JSON path type queries
    - IP address parsing
    - regular expressions
- many advantages
- but it's different, some things are harder
    - distinct values are tricky
    - joins with large datasets are tricky
???
- SQL is cheap to parallelize but aggregation is complex
- these are expensive in a normal relational database that has indices
---
